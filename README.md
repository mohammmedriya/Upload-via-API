Over the years we have created dozens of Computer Vision tutorials. This repository contains examples and tutorials on using SOTA computer vision models and techniques. Learn everything from old-school ResNet, through YOLO and object-detection transformers like DETR, to the latest models like Grounding DINO and SAM.

Computer Vision moves fast! Sometimes our notebooks lag a tad behind the ever-pushing forward libraries. If you notice that any of the notebooks is not working properly, create a bug report and let us know.

If you have an idea for a new tutorial we should do, create a feature request. We are constantly looking for new ideas. If you feel up to the task and want to create a tutorial yourself, please take a peek at our contribution guide. There you can find all the information you need.

We are here for you, so don't hesitate to reach out.
